## linx front end challenge

***importante***  I had some problems with firefox blocking the products images, which didn't happen on Brave or Google Chrome.

### `challenge`

The [challenge](https://github.com/chaordic/frontend-developer-challenge) was to build a landing page with a grid of products and a newsletter form based on this [layout](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/4025e242-a495-4594-71d2-5fd89d774b57-3614/grid).

### `running`

* Option one

    0. Clone this repository.
    0. Open the ```index.html``` file in the browser.

* Option two

    0. Go to the repo for the live version [here](https://github.com/lucazpinheiro/live-demo-challenge).
    0. Clone the repository.
    0. Run the commands ```npm install``` and ```npm start```

### `what I couldn't do`

I couldn't implement the styling exactly as the given layout, so I decided to focus on making the page the most similar possible with the expected behavior regarding the product grid loading and the "Ainda mais produtos aqui!" button. I specific struggle to implement the responsiveness, I only implemented it for the mobile version. Also, one thing I wanted to do but didn't have the time was to add submission handling logic for the forms.
